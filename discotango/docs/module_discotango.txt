Documentation
-------------
The Discotango discovery service is a PoC implementation of a geolocation 
enabled discovery service. The discovery service will display ench entity from 
metadata in a filtered list only listing the entities that are visible in the 
map. Each entity can have multiple locations accociated with it.

Setup
-----
To use the discotango discovery service, you will have to download the source 
code and place it in the modules directory in your simpleSAMLphp installation.

Then you have to enable the module by placing an empty file in the discotango 
directory called 'enable'.

You will have to add geolocation information to each of the entities you are 
using. NOTE: The dicsotango discovery service vill read metadata from the 
saml2-idp-remote.php and not XML metadata.

The geolocation data is to inserted for each entity. The format is as
following:

    'GeolocationHint' => array(
        0 => array(
            'coord' => 'xx.xxxxx,yy.yyyy',
            'description' => 'Extra info about the location',
        ),
        ...
    ),

You can add as many locations for each entity as you like. Entities that do not 
contain at least one GeolocationHint will not be displayed in the discovery
service.

The last thing you need to do, is to direct your service to use the Discotango 
discovery service URL.
